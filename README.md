# TNT-Throw
This Spigot Plugin gives players the abilty to throw lit tnt instead of having to place it down. Not only that, but you have the ability to set the velocity of the tnt. This allows for you to make really cool dcool things with the throwable tnt. It is really fun to just mess around with and do some cool things with the velocity. In order to change the velocity, you have to change the config.yml. Here is the format your config should have:
```
Velocity: 2
```
After that, just change the number to set the velocity. It is a simple yet oddly addictive plugin that I'm sure you will love.
